Darcula Look and Feel

This is a fork of bulenkov's original Darcula that currently adds the following features:

* JToolBars have rollover enabled (thus toolbar buttons appear flat)
* JButtons in tool bars look like those in IntelliJ 2016 when armed/rollover
* Application font matches desktop's default (on Windows)
* Minor margins around menu items in menus
* Bezel effect on disabled JButtons' text is removed
* JMenuBar dims when the application loses focus
* Built with Java 7 instead of Java 8

Coming soon:

* Text component background darkens slightly when focused
* Application font matches desktop's default (on OS X and Linux)
* Nicer-looking split pane
* Custom-drawn window decorations (if I find the time/motivation)
